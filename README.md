# Hangman

Hangman made with React.

The word-to-be-guessed will be a country name, which comes from a JavaScript array of countries (credit: [Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/array-of-country-names/)).

You enter individual letters to try and guess the word. You have a chance to make five incorrect guesses. You can also enter the entire country name, but if it is incorrect then you lose immediately.

Letters are case-insensitive. Also, you do not need to enter whitespaces or special characters, just letters. Any apostrophes in the country name will be converted to a single whitespace.
